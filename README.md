This is the source code for Percy (a [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) extension).
Percy is a open source extension for [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) which aims to free you from the grip of the Animation Timeline.
Although the Animation Timeline is useful there may be times when you only need the layers.

# Installation
Install percy by [downloading the pck file](https://github.com/TheLsbt/PixeloramaExtensions/blob/master/Percy.pck) and drag it onto a [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) Window
